QUESTIONS:
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

ANSWER:
THE GAME ROOM WAS A CLIENT THAT WANTED A WEB APPLICATION MODELED AFTER THE 1970'S TV game SHOW DRAW IT OR LOSE IT. DURING THIS STENT OF WORKING ON THE APPLICATION PROGRESSION WAS MADE AS DEVELOPER IN IDENTIFYING APPROPRIATE CODE FOR THE MODULES THAT NEEDED TO BE UPDATED. IN WORKING ON THE DESIGN DOCUMENTATION & PROVIDING INSIGHT TO THE MAJOR CONCEPTS, CONSTRAINTS AND CODE EXPLANATION SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN HAD BEEN EXPLORED. THIS PROJECT ALSO ALLOWED PRIVY IN TO SOME MORE LOWER LEVEL DESIGN STRUCTURES, IE CLOUD OPERATION, SECURITY, AND SERVER IMPLEMENTATION AND INTERACTION (FORM VALIDATION). IN RETRO SPECT ONE THING I COULD IMPROVE IS COMMENTING, THIS IS FROM 'KNOWING AND NOT SHOWING' WHICH CAN LEAD TO GREATER REGRESS WHEN PROGRAMING MORE COMPLICATED AND ORNATE STRUCTURES. CONSIDERATION OF THE USERS NEED ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS A DEVELOPER WE DO NOT WANT TO SEND THE CLIENT IN TO SHOCK WITH A GROTESQUE AMOUNT OF LOUD OBSCENE NOISE OR LIGHT WHICH MAY CAUSE INJURY OR RESULT IN DEATH. DESIGNING THE SOFTWARE WAS DONE WITH THE GUIDE OF FIX ME ANNOTATIONS WHICH POINTED THE WAY TO INCOMPLETE CODE BLOCKS OR CODE FAILURES. EVERY PROJECT STARTS WITH AN IDEA AND GROWS IN DESIGNING AN APPLICATION LOOKING FOR THE CORRECT API WILL AID IN THE QUICK DEVELOPMENT OF A PROTOTYPE APPLICATION THAT CAN BE REFACTORED AS PROGRESS IS MADE.
